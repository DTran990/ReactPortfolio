                    <p>Based in Toronto Ontario, I am a 4th year Ryerson University student studying mathematics with a computer science specialization. I am a self-taught developer highly proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript with strong problem solving skills and a driven self-learner with various knowledge in different programming languages and concepts. Alongside the many computer science courses I take for school, I spend a lot of time learning and improving as a developer in my spare time. You can find my work on my <a href="https://github.com/DTran990" target="_blank">Github Profile</a>. Feel free to contact me through LinkedIn, or by Email for any inquiries.</p>
